<h1>Quick summary</h1></h1>

<b>Internets explained</b> <em>again...</em>
<p>Always helpful to have a basic refresher on the big picture of the web. 
  In the end its basically a big retrieval system where we enter a <em>url</em> 
  to send our request which is an <em>HTTP Request</em> to servers aka more 
  computers to retrieve the <em>HTML documents</em> that are then displayed in 
  our browser.

<b>HTML Elements</b> 
<p>Tags + attributes = elements. Tags are simple instructions or signposts informing your computer how 
  you want it to handle the text or image or link between them. Although 
  I've been familiar with tags for a long time I never understood what 
  a <em>void tag</em> was. And this overview helped solve the mysetery of the break 
  <code>  br </code>tag. And the <code> img </code> tag. Some examples of the tags are covered are below.
</p>  

<xmp> <em></em> for emphasis <b></b> for bold</xmp>

<b>HTML attributes</b>
<p>HTML attributes (atrribute is a property of an HTML element)
Some html elements with attributes include:</p>  
 <xmp> <a href="url>text</a>" <img src="image" and alt="descriptor"></xmp>
</p>

<b>Elements 2 types</b>
<p>Inline vs block elements.  Inline elements do not break the text into chunks almost like a string of typed text. 
Block elements create an invisible box around the text. Two important ones mentioned that link up with CSS are
<code>span</code> and <code> div</code>.  <xmp><span> Inline </span> <div> block text </div></xmp>

<b>When in doubt remember your incredible google skills.</b>
<p>Glad to hear this final message. I can give myself a sigh of relief in knowing that I don't have to memerize every tag. 
Also this stuff changes rapidly. That mention of HTML 5 was a little clue. </p>
